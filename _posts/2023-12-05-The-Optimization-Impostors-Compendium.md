Last July, after six terrific years I left AMPL Optimization, Inc., - the rockstar team behind the algebraic modeling language and ecosystem of the same name, used in large-scale mathematical optimization.

To sell AMPL and solvers like Gurobi, CPLEX and others, I would help customer teams build and repair optimization models in energy systems, manufacturing, logistics, quantitative finance and so on. The ability to compute problems so large as would crash other toolchains, and to produce solutions seemingly faster than by other means, earns AMPL and these powerful solvers their reputations in the high-performance optimization market.

Customer teams at times needed help building new models from scratch, in the service of which my former team recently released a solid resource: the <a href="https://mo-book.ampl.com/" target="_blank">MO-Book</a> geared especially to Python-scripted applications.

But more often than not, practitioners I met wanted help speeding up some existing application, and threw open for debate not just their mathematical formulation but also every product and tool in their toolchain, and their runtime environment and underlying hardware. These engagements were my bliss: I learned optimization in my early years at AMPL, but had been a consummate hardware geek, generalist hacker and right stubborn ox for years prior, and I loved the challenge of pursuing performance beyond what conventional wisdom might have deemed realistic.

I have wanted to collect and share some generalized insights relating to speeding optimization applications for some years now - and to learn new things in the process - but the time never came for this while at AMPL. My desire remains and so, world, to hell with it: here is the 'The Optimization Impostors' Compendium' aka opt-models.org, now live and growing at ...

(I am having a lot of fun making it hope it might be useful to some.)
